# 5. Changing the Number of GPUs

Let's rerun the fine-tuning task with a different number of GPUs. MoAI Platform abstracts GPU resources into a single accelerator and automatically performs parallel processing. Therefore, there is no need to modify the PyTorch script even when changing the number of GPUs.


## Changing the Accelerator type

Switch the accelerator type using the **`moreh-switch-model`** tool. For instructions on changing the accelerator, please refer again to the [3. Model fine-tuning](3_fine_tuning.md).

```bash
$ moreh-switch-model
```

Please contact your infrastructure provider and choose one of the following options before proceeding.  

- AMD MI250 GPU with 32 units
    - When using Moreh's trial container: select [!badge variant="secondary" text="8xlarge"]
    - When using KT Cloud's Hyperscale AI Computing: select [!badge variant="secondary" text="8xLarge.4096GB"]
- AMD MI210 GPU with 64 units
- AMD MI300X GPU with 16 units


## Training Parameters
Again, run the **`train_llama3.py`** script.

```bash
~/quickstart$ python tutorial/train_llama3.py --batch-size 512
```

Since the available GPU memory has doubled, let's increase the batch size from the previous 256 to 512 and run the code again.

```

If the training proceeds normally, you will see similar logs to the previous run but with improved throughput due to the doubled number of GPUs.

- When using AMD MI250 GPU 16 â†’ 32 : From approximately 200,000 tokens/sec to 390,000 tokens/sec.
